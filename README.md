# Kart Racing

## Description

I worked on this project with 2 classmates at the university. Together, we created a kart racing in Unity. The game includes two karts: one controlled by the player and another one controlled by an AI using NavMeshAgent for navigation. It tracks the time for both karts and displays the winner at the end. The player's kart speed and timer are also displayed during the race. Enjoy!
